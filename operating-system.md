## Definition:
An operating system (OS) is software that serves as a bridge between computer hardware and its user.

Almost all software acts as an enabler, and operating systems are no exception. The OS manages computer resources providing a  layer software applications can leverage to better function.

Without operating systems, each software application will have to manage resources, from the CPU, RAM to inputs from the keyboard. The operating system manages the interaction between the software, the computer, and the user. This way, when software [developers](developer.md) create [software](software.md), they can focus on the functionalities of the software itself, knowing the OS will handle the rest.

## Use cases and Examples
Examples of operating systems include Android, Chrome OS, IOS, Mac OS, and Windows.

## Summary:
Operating systems have also helped us standardize software distribution, meaning developers can make assumptions regarding where the software will be installed without accessing the users' hardware during development.
