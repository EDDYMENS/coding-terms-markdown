## Definition

In simple words, code is a set of instructions written down using a [programming language](programming-language.md), meant to be processed by a computer. 

## Use Cases and Examples

When a programmer writes a "Hello, World!" program in the C programming language, the code looks like this:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
Similarly, the code for writing a "Hello, World!" program in the Java programming language looks like this:
class HelloWorld 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
{
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
This is saved in a text file-like file usually with a special extension at the end of the file, for example, our C program above can be saved as `hello_word.c`.

Another alternative term used for code in the programming world is [source code](source-code.md). Usually, software developers will reserve the term source code to mean a group of "code files" that make up a piece of software and use the term code to just refer to one file or a line of instruction.

## Summary
Also, the act of writing software is sometimes referred to as coding.
