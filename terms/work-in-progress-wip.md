## Definition
Work In Progress is a term used to describe unfinished work. This can be code, documentation, testing, etc.

## Use cases and Examples

You will find the term used as a label usually in its short-form **WIP** in places where other developers can see the work of their colleagues.

One of such popular places is in [GIT](https://git-scm.com) messages. The message lets others know the code or document is still being worked on and might not work or should not be touched.

WIP is also used in [comments](comment.md) within a [codebase](code.md).
