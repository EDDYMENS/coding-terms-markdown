## Definition

A database is a collection of information that has been structured for easy access, administration, and updating.

Databases are designed to make it easy to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data, among other data-processing activities.

## Use Cases and Examples

In software development, a developer interacts with the database using a particular language known as a query language. Popular examples include SQL and MQL.

Databases are of many types.  Most categorization is based on how the data is structured and stored.

**Here are a few examples:**

Relational database: Uses the concepts of tables to store data. Each table comprises columns and rows. A relationship can be formed between tables as well.
No SQL database: Relational databases require that the table structure be defined before storing any data. No SQL databases do not require a structure to be defined before use. It's up to the developer to maintain the data structure.

Graph database: They use graph theory techniques to store, map, and query relationships. Nodes and edges are the building blocks of graph databases. The main point of such a database is to create useful links between the data stored. This is good for applications where the discovery of relationships is essential. For example, social network applications.

## Summary

Databases are key to any software application that needs to store, retrieve and work with data in any way.
