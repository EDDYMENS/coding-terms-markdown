## Definition
Pseudocode is a simple, stripped-down version of a [programming language](programming-language.md) with relaxed [syntax](syntax.md) rules used to explain logic, code, or semantics.
To make it easy to understand, it usually has much more natural language constructs i.e: English, French words, etc., than the near cryptic constructs used in programming languages.

## Use cases and Examples
As mentioned above, pseudocode is used as a tool to walk through what a program needs to do.
It can be used to teach or as a tool to think up optimal programming solutions. 

Here is an example pseudocode that applies a discount to a purchasePrice

```
User inputs purchasePrice

if purchasePrice equals or is greater than 40 
	finalPrice is 80% of purchasePrice 
else 
       finalPrice is same as purchasePrice

output finalPrice
```
 
## Summary
There is no defined syntax for pseudocode. The goal is to convey programming ideas without the overhead of making sure the language is used in its most correct way.
