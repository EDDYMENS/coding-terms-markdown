## Definition

You can think of a variable like a bucket used to hold or store substance, in this the substance to be stored is data to be used within a program.

## Use cases and Examples

```
var x = 1;
var result = 2 +x;
console.log("result contains: ", result);
```
The above Javascript code has two variables namely `x` is assigned the value `1` and result to the sum of `2` and `x` which should be `3`;

## Summary
Variables usually can store whatever data type is available within the programming language under discussion.
