## Definition
We get a much better web experience today than we did in the early 2000s. The growth and improvement of web technologies have fostered these improvements.

Among the improvement are the growth of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) [programming language](programming-language.md) and the introduction of Single page applications SPA.

The goal of frontend frameworks is to bring all of this together so developers can provide a modern web experience more easily.

## Use cases and Examples
Some of the popular frontend frameworks include [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [VueJs](https://vuejs.org).

These frameworks provide a host of things out of the box, some of which include: 
- **Routing:** which is the process of determining which page gets served to the user when they visit a particular URL
- **Folder structure:** Instead of coming up with a folder structure, most frameworks provide you with one so every developer familiar with the project knows where to find what
- **Templating:** One core part of web development is the creation and working with templates, which are web layouts like the interface you see where different data set can be presented.

The above list is by no means comprehensive of what frontend frameworks offer.

## Summary
Frameworks provide different functionalities, and how you choose one ultimately depends on what your needs are, among other things.
