## Definition
A sandbox is an environment or setup that is usually a duplicate of a software product reserved for development or testing purposes.

## Use Cases and Examples
Integrating into a live system can be tricky, for example, if you are integrating a third party [payment processor](payment-processor.md) without a sandbox you will likely have to perform actual payments during testing which is not ideal. 

Sandbox environments are generally used by developers to test out their work as well as all the features a third-party product has to offer. 

Some software products also use their sandbox environment for demo purposes during the sales process.

## Summary
Sandboxing improves a technical product's developer experience and can be a make-it-or-break-it factor for companies and developers.
