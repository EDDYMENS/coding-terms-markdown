## Definition

Technical debt is a term used to define the cost in terms of resources that are incurred when a programmer goes with a solution to a task that will require some changes or improvements in the future.


## Use Cases and Examples

The issue of technical debt is more of a management problem caused due to a lack of ineffective planning and following poor project management practices for the most part.

A typical example is setting up a [server](server.md) that might not scale past a given number of users, this means down the line the developers will have to revisit this setup and make changes.

## Summary

Technical debt is the price paid for unplanned work that has to be incurred due to inefficiencies of project management.
