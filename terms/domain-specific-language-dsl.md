## Definition 
Domain-specific languages(DSL) are [programming languages](programming-language.md) tailored for specific programmatic tasks.

## Use Cases and Examples
[General-purpose](general-purpose.md) programming languages such as python, javascript, PHP allows you to do a host of tasks. This means they require a lot of different constructs, which usually lead to a lot of [syntax](syntax.md) and [semantic](semantic.md) rules that require some mental fortitude to use.

On the other hand, the problems a DSL solves are limited. This makes it possible for its designers to introduce a much friendlier syntax and fewer semantic rules. 

This makes DSLs a good solution for software products where the user needs to make some programmatic changes. 

Examples of DSL include: 

- Spreadsheet formulas.
- SQL which is primarily used to work with databases.
- The Linux SED command is also a DSL used for text file manipulation.

## Summary
DSLs are usually created using general-purpose languages, so they do not require their own compilers or interpreters but rather leverage the underlying one from the programming language in use.
