## Definition

A transpiler converts one [programming language](programming-language.md) [syntax](syntax.md) to another.

## Use Cases and Examples

Why would you want to convert one programming language to another?

Well imagine the situation where you will like to introduce special syntax to the programming language you are working with, either out of convenience or maybe to make it easier for non-technical team members to contribute to the [source code](source-code.md).

In this case instead of designing a new programming language and build a [compiler](compiler.md) or [interpreter](interpreter.md) for it , you can transpile the language to an existing one and leverage its existing compiler or interpreter.

An example of a transpiled programming language is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) which is converted to [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Summary

Transpilers help engineering teams leverage existing technology to introduce new ways of doing things.
