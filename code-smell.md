## Definition
Code smell refers to hints one sees in a codebase that might lead to the software having issues as its development continues. 
This issues can include not being able to maintain or add new features to the software easily.

## Use cases and Examples
The term code smell is used often when a part of a codebase is written in a way that it violates some coding pattern.
For example one way of writing software that can lead to code smells is [spaghetti code](spaghetti-code.md)

## Summary
Abstraction happens at different levels of computing from logic gates, compilers to the code itself. 

It greatly helps programmers to focus on newer problems instead of every bolt and nut of their software or the hardware they are working with.
