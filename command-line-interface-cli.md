## Definition
The command-line interface is a program that allows you to interact with other programs by typing out textual commands into a prompt.

## Use cases and Examples
The command-line interface used to be the primary way of interacting with a computer, and all instructions had to either be passed in as text or written in a file and run altogether. 

These days, everyday computer users hardly use the command line interface. It, however, remains popular among developers. It provides a more effective and concise way to interact with computers.

Creating command line tools are less time consuming to develop compared to [graphic user interface (gui)](graphic-user-interface-gui.md).
Developers prefer to create their tools as command-line-based tools hence why its use is widespread among developers.

There is also the element of [scripting](shell-scripting.md) which allows a developer to create a script to execute a series of instructions all at once, as opposed to typing them out one after the other. 

For the everyday users most of their [software](software.md) come with the [graphic user interface (GUI)](graphic-user-interface-gui.md) which uses visual elements to take in input and display results to the end-user. This is a  lot more intuitive and pleasant to use.

## Summary
The command line has been around for ages and remains useful today. Most tools you will have to work with as a developer are only accessible through the command line.
